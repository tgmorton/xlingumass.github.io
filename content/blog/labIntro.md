The XLing Labs are an academic work group consisting of three labs: Prof. John Kingston's [{{<fa arrow-up-right-from-square>}}](https://blogs.umass.edu/jkingstn/) Phonetics lab, Prof. Brian Dillon's [{{<fa arrow-up-right-from-square>}}](https://www.umass.edu/linguistics/member/brian-dillon) Cognitive Science of Language Lab, and Prof. Shota Momma's [{{<fa arrow-up-right-from-square>}}](https://shotam.github.io/) Grammar and Processing lab.

These three labs combine to make up the largest psycholinguistic community at the University of Massachussets Amherst.
