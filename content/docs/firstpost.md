Hi everyone, welcome to the new XLing Labs site. This should be a flexible new framework for the lab and its members to highlight new work and documentation. It's also a good place to put common information like scheduling!

In this document I'm going to break down some of the basic actions you can do to expand this website. We're going to cover, first, how you can edit an existing page on the website and later, we'll discuss how you can add whole new pages. 

# Editing an existing page

Editing an existing page is very very easy! Every editable page should have have a button that says ``Suggest Changes`` at the top of the page. When you click that button you will be directed to the website www.github.com[{{<fa arrow-up-right-from-square>}}](http://github.com). Github is what's called a 'version control system' and its job is to make sure that people can easily edit one part of a document or program without making changes to everything else. 

If you want to suggest changes to a document you should make an account on Github and, when you're ready, you can make your edits in your browser after clicking the edit button:
